Config players
==============

An important concept to using the YAML-based configuration files is something
called "config players".

Config players are used to "play" settings from a config file or show file.
Don't be misled by the word "player" in "config_players". Config players have
nothing to do with the human players of a pinball machine, rather, they're used
to "play" settings from config files.

There are several different config players in MPF and MPF-MC:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   slide_player
