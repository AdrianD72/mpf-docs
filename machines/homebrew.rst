Controlling a custom "home brew" machine with MPF
=================================================
If you want to use MPF to power a new *custom* pinball machine that you build
yourself, you can buy new custom driver boards from the same people who make the
P-ROC, FAST, or OPP Pinball controllers.

Details for how to build custom machine hardware are covered on the
`PinballMakers.com Wiki <http://pinballmakers.com>`_.
