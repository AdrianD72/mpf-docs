Mission Pinball Framework Documentation (mpf-docs)
==================================================

<img align="right" height="146" src="_static/images/mpf-logo-200.png"/>

This repo is the documentation for the Mission Pinball Framework.

Since this is new with MPF 0.30, we have to convert all the docs from
HTML to ReStructured Text format. We used an automated tool to do that
in bulk. Those raw docs are in the _not_updated_yet folder. We're going
to go through them one-by-one, update them to MPF 0.30, and then add
them to the MPF proper location here.

This will probably take months. :)

In the meantime, you can know that anything you see on the
docs.missionpinball.org site has been updated and applies to MPF 0.30.

If you want to help with the conversion, feel free! Just fork the repo,
make a change, and submit a pull request.
