MPF Tutorial
============

Hi! I'm Brian Madden, one of the creators of MPF. This tutorial is written in a
conversational style, so I thought it would be weird if I used the terms "I" and
"my" but you didn't actually know who was on the other end of the documentation.

So... you want to write your own software fora pinball machine? Awesome!
Hopefully you're a little crazy, because it's a lot of work. But seriously,
this is awesome, and with MPF you can get a basic game up and running pretty
quickly.

If you're not a computure programmer, that's fine. We'll step through everything
exactly. If you run into any problems, feel free to email be at mailto:brian@missionpinball.com.
Or ping me via twitter (`@missionpinball <http://twitter.com/missionpinball>`).
I want to make sure this tutorial is completely accurate and easy to understand.

The only other thing to keep in mind is that MPF itself is still in development.
The first number in the MPF version is a zero :) Just let me know if you run
into any problems.

Here's how this tutorial process works:

#. Follow all the steps in the tutorial, in order. (Each step builds
   on the previous one, and every machine needs the things from every
   step.) This will give you a basic, playable game, complete with multi-
   player support, an attract mode, lights, shots, points, and a basic
   game mode.
#. When you're done with the tutorial, browse our :doc:`How To guides </howto/index>`.
   (These are like the "cookbook" or "recipe" approach.) The How To
   guides can be followed in whatever order you want, and you don't have
   to do all of them for your machine.

The key is that you have to complete every step in the tutorial in order, and
after that you can do whatever else you want.

By the way, this tutorial outlines the exact process I follow myself whenever I
walk up to a new MPF running.
