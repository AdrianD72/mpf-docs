Tutorial step 5: Add a display
==============================

In this step, we're going to add a graphical on-screen window which
will help show what's happening in your machine as it runs. If you're
planning to put an LCD display in the backbox of your machine, this is
what we'll setup now. And if you want to use a physical DMD (whether it's
an older-style mono DMD, or a newer full color LED-based DMD), you'll also
be able to use this on screen window as the source for the content you
show on your DMD. (Regardless of what type of display you want to use in your
final machine, follow this step in the tutorial and then you can setup your
final display later by following the How To guides.)

To configure a graphical window with MPF, we're going to start using
a new part of MPF called the "media controller."

1. Understand what the Media Controller is
------------------------------------------

One of the most important things to understand about the architecture
of MPF is that the core MPF game engine is completely separate from
the process that controls graphics and audio. We call the thing that
handles graphics and audio a "media controller." So far in this tutorial, we've only
been dealing with the MPF game engine (which is launched via the
``mpf`` command). But when you run a complete pinball machine
with MPF, you actually run two processesâ€”-the MPF game engine and a separate
standalone media controller. The game engine and media controller talk to
each other via something called "BCP" (which stands for "Backbox Control
Protocol").

Here's a diagram that shows what each piece does:

.. image:: mpf_game_engine_mc.png

Note that you typically run the MPF game engine and the media controller together on the same computer.

The MPF package you installed (called ``mpf-mc``) includes a
Media Controller which you can launch via the ``mpf mc`` command), and that's what we'll
use in this tutorial. (There are a group of MPF users who have written an alternate media controller in Unity 3D,
but that's not something we're going to cover here.)

2. Run the media controller to see how it works
-----------------------------------------------

Let's run the MPF media controller from your machine folder so you can see how it works. You do that with the ``mpf mc``
command, like this:

::

    C:\pinball\your_machine>mpf mc

When you do this, you should see an 800 x 600 popup window that's completely black with the title
"Mission Pinball Framework". Here's an example from Mac OS X:

.. image:: blank_mpf_mc_window.png

You can close this window (and exit the MPF MC) by hitting the ``Esc`` key. (If this doesn't
work, click your mouse in the popup window to give it focus and try again.)

You can also exit the MPF MC and close the popup window from the command line via ``CTRL+C``.

3. Add a "display" to your config file
--------------------------------------

Now that you know how to run the media controller (or "MC", as we often call it), let's configure it so it shows some
actual content.

The first step is to create a "display" in your MPF config, which is like an internal representation of a canvas that
holds graphical content which can be shown on an LCD screen or a DMD. The MPF-MC can have multiple display canvases at
the same time, and you can map different ones to different physical displays.

The only setting for each display we need to worry about now is the height and width, both defined in terms of the
number of pixels.

So for now, let's create a single display called "window" which which we'll set to 800x600. To do this, add
the following to your ``config.yaml`` file:

::

   displays:
     window:
       width: 800
       height: 600

Make sure that the word ``displays:`` has no spaces in front of it, since it's a top-level config item.

Note that in the example above, we used 2 spaces for the indentation instead of 4. That's fine, YAML doesn't care. (And
you can even mix-and-match in the same file.) The only spacing thing that matters is items at the same level are
indented the same number of spaces (like "width" and "height"). Also, no tabs.

Anyway, in this example, the display is called "window". You can name your display whatever you want. For example,
here's a display called "potato" which is 100x100:

::

   displays:
      potato:
         width: 100
         height: 100

Even though you can name your displays whatever you want, some names are magic and have special properties. For example,
when the on-screen window is created, it will "attach" itself (to show content from) one of the displays you have
defined here in the ``displays:`` section of your machine config. So to us, it's just more convenient to name the
display in a way that describes where it will actually be shown.

One final note about displays that you specify in your ``displays:`` section. The size (height and width) of your
displays here are independent from the actual physical displays (windows and DMDs). For example, the size of the
on-screen window is specified in the ``window:`` section of the machine config (which is 800x600 by default). So if you
change the size of your display here (perhaps to 320x240), then the on-screen window will still be 800x600, and the
content of the display canvas will be 320x240 (but scaled up to the 800x600 window). This means that MPF is
"resolution independent", in that you can build your game for a certain display size and then scale it up or down to
fit on whatever physical display is there later.

For now, though, you don't have to worry about any of that. Just create a display called "window" at 800x600 to get
through the tutorial, and then we'll show you how to change it via the How To guides later.

Also, if your machine is going to use a physical DMD (whether mono or color), or if you want to have the "dot look"
of an on-screen DMD on an LCD screen, for now just follow along the tutorial as is, and then you can read the How To
guides afterwards to configure your displays. (Everything we do in the tutorial will transfer over no prob.)

4. Add a slide & a text widget
------------------------------

Ok, so now we have a display called "window". If you run ``mpf mc``, you will still see the black popup window (just
like Step 2) since we haven't actually told the window to show anything. So in this step, we're going to add some
content to the window display, starting with some simple text.

To do this, you need to understand some basic concepts about how the display system works in the MPF media
controller.

Since the folks who originally started MPF spend a lot of time giving presentations, the display concepts and
terminology are pulled from presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote. So if you're
familiar with those, you should be familiar with the display concepts in the MPF MC.

First is the concept of "slides". Just like a PowerPoint presentation, an MPF display shows a slide. Many
slides can exist, but only one is shown at a time, and that slide takes up the entire display. (Just like how a
PowerPoint slide takes up the whole display when you're playing the slide show.)

In MPF-MC, when one slide switches to another, there can be an animated "transition", like fade, push in, move out,
etc.

A slide is like a blank canvas that you put things on. The "things", in this case, are called "widgets".
MPF has different types of widgets, for example, text, images, videos, shapes, lines, etc. When you put a
widget on a slide, you can specify all sorts of properties, like the size, position, alignment, colors, etc.

One slide can have lots of different widgets, and you can specify the order widgets are drawn to control
which ones are "on top" of others. You can add and remove widgets from existing slides at any time, and you can
also animate widget properties, meaning you can change the opacity (to make them flash), or you can
animate their position, size, etc.

All of this will become more clear throughout the tutorial, so let's just jump right in.

In order to show some text, we have to create a slide, add our text to that slide, and then show that slide
on the display.

First, let's create the slide. There are several ways to do this, so we're just going to show you one way
here and then you can read the How To guides later for more options.

In MPF, all slides have names. You define slides in the ``slides:`` section of the config. So let's create a
slide called "welcome_slide", like this:

::

   slides:
      welcome_slide:

Now let's add a ``widgets:`` section under that slide, then under that, we'll start creating some widgets.

::

   slides:
      welcome_slide:
         widgets:

You can add as many widgets as you want to a slide. (And it's pretty common for slides to be made up of lots of widgets.

To add a widget, you write a dash, then space, then the settings for the widget you want to add.

All widgets have a ``type:`` setting which specifies what type widget it is. (Examples of widget types include text,
image, video, rectangle, ellipse, line, triangle, etc.)

Then there are additional settings that control how that widget looks. Some settings are universal for all widget types
(such at the settings that control the positioning on the display), and other settings are specify to each type of
widget (the *text* widget has settings that specify the font name and what the text it, the *triangle* widget has settings
that specify the x,y positions of the corners, etc.)

Again, we have lots of docs on this, so for now just follow along in the tutorial for now and you can go nuts with the
How Tos later.

So we want to add a text widget with text that reads "PINBALL!". So add the following to your config:

::

   slides:
      welcome_slide:
         widgets:
           - type: text
             text: PINBALL!

There are a few things going on there.

First, notice that before the word ``type:``, there's a dash (hyphen), followed by a space. This is how you specify a new
list item in YAML. (Think of it kind of like a bullet in YAML.) You need to do this when specifying widgets since we can
add lots of widgets to a single slide, so this is what tells the YAML file (and MPF-MC) where the settings for one widget
end and the next begin.

Second, the space AFTER the dash is important. WRONG: ``-type: text``  RIGHT: ``- type: text``

It's probably obviously, but the setting ``type: text`` is telling MPF-MC that this entry is for a text widget. And the
``text: PINBALL!`` is setting the text for this widget to be "PINBALL!". (For now we're just hard-coding the text to be
"PINBALL!", but in the future we'll look at how you can use dynamically-updating text (like for the player score) that
updates automatically whenever it changes.

Now run ``mpf mc`` and what do you see?

A blank window again! :(

The reason the window is still black is because even though we created a slide (called "welcome_slide") and we added a
widget to that slide, we didn't actually configure MPF-MC to *show* that slide. So let's do that now.

5. Add a slide_player config
----------------------------

Next, create a new section in your config called ``slide_player:``. The slide_player watches for certain events to
occur, and when they do, it "plays" a slide.

To see this in action, add the following section to your machine config:

::

   slide_player:
      mc_ready: welcome_slide

What this is doing is saying, "When the event called *mc_ready* happens, play the slide called *welcome_slide*." The
*mc_ready* is an event that's posted by MPF-MC at the earliest possible point when it is ready after it initially starts
up (literally it's saying "the MC is ready"). So what we're doing here is telling MPF-MC to show our welcome slide as
soon as it can.

To verify, run ``mpf mc`` again, and hopefully you see something like this:

.. image:: mc_pinball_1.png

Cool! We have text! Of course it's kind of small, and white, but it confirms that everything is working. (So again,
what's actually happening here is you have a display called "window", which is showing a slide called "welcome_slide",
and that slide has a single widget, which is a text widget with its text set to "PINBALL!".)

There are lots of settings for each widget type that you can use in your config file. For example, let's change the
font size and the color, like this:

::

   slides:
     welcome_slide:
       widgets:
         - type: text
           text: PINBALL!
           font_size: 50
           color: red

Now when you run ``mpf mc`` again, you should see this:

.. image:: mc_pinball_2.png

Colors in the MPF-MC can be specified by name (like "red") or by hex value ("ff0000"). Note that if you
specify a color by hex value, do NOT put a ``#`` in it, since YAML files use those for comments which
are ignored. RIGHT: ``color: ff0000``  WRONG: ``color: #ff0000``

By default, the widget is centered in the slide, but you can play with different settings to position it wherever you
want. (Check out :doc:`/howto/display/widget_positioning` for details.)

6. Add a second widget
----------------------

We already mentioned that you can add as many widgets as you want to a slide and that there are lots
of different kinds of widgets. Let's add a second widget to your welcome slide. This one will be a
rectangle which appears behind the word "PINBALL!".

::

   slides:
     welcome_slide:
       widgets:
         - type: text
           text: PINBALL!
           font_size: 50
           color: red
         - type: rectangle
           width: 240
           height: 60

Again, note that you use a dash followed by a space to denote the start of the second widget. This
widget's type is "rectangle", with its height and width specified. Since we're not specifying any
position, it will be centered (just like the other widget), and since we're not specifying a color,
it will be white.

Now when you run ``mpf mc``, you should see this:

.. image:: mc_pinball_3.png

Note that the word "PINBALL!" is "on top" of the white rectangle. That's because the order of the
widgets on the display matches the order they're entered into the config file. So in this example,
since the text widget comes first in the list of widgets for the welcome slide, the text widget is
on top. If you switch the order and run ``mpf mc`` again, you'll just see the white rectangle with
no text, since the rectangle would be "on top" and it would completely cover the PINBALL! text.

7. Run MPF-MC and the MPF game engine at the same time
------------------------------------------------------

Ok, so now we're able to run the media controller and to get a some widgets to show up. But so far,
we were just running ``mpf mc`` which is running the media controller by itself, without the MPF
game engine running.

So in this step, we're going to run them both at the same time.

The first thing we need to do is add another slide to our config for the MC to play, and this time
we'll make that slide play on a different event.

So in your ``slides:`` section, add another slide called ``attract_started``, like this:

::

   slides:
     welcome_slide:
       widgets:
         - type: text
           text: PINBALL!
           font_size: 50
           color: red
         - type: rectangle
           width: 240
           height: 60
     attract_started:
       widgets:
         - text: ATTRACT MODE
           type: text

Note that ``attract_started:`` is indented the same number of spaces as ``welcome_slide:``. Also
note that in the attract_started slide, we switched the order of ``text:`` and ``type:``. We did that
here just to demonstrate that the order of settings in the config doesn't matter.

If you run this, nothing different will happen because all we did here in the slides section is
define a slide. We need to use the ``slide_player:`` section to actually play the slide when some
event happens.

So next, go to the ``slide_player:`` section of your config and add an entry for the event
``mode_attract_started``. (This is the event that is posted whenever a mode starts, in the form of
*mode_<mode_name>_started*.)

By the way, if you're wondering how we know what events to use, there's an :doc:`/events/index` in the documentation
(check the tree view on the left) which has a list of all the events in MPF as well as descriptions of when
they're posted. You can use any of these as triggers for your slides via the ``slide_player:``.

Anyway, add the ``mode_attract_started`` to your ``slide_player:`` like this:

::

   slide_player:
     mc_ready: welcome_slide
     mode_attract_started: attract_started

Again, this is saying you want the slide called "attract_started" to play when the event called
"mode_attract_started" happens.

Now run ``mpf mc`` again. At this point you should see the welcome slide. (You see the welcome slide
because the MPF game engine isn't running, and the game engine is responsible for starting and stopping
modes. So no game engine means no attract mode, and no attract mode means no *attract_mode_started*
event, which means no *attract_started* slide.)

Now open a second terminal window and switch into your game folder and launch the MPF game engine.
Remember from prior steps that we ran MPF with the ``-b`` option which told MPF to *not* try to
connect to the MPF-MC. But now we have the MC running, so we want to run MPF without ``-b`` so it connects.

So this time, just run ``mpf``, like this:

::

    C:\pinball\your_machine>mpf

When you run MPF, after some stuff scrolls by, you should see the *attract_started* slide replace
the *welcome_slide*, like this:

.. image:: 5_mode_attract_started.png

So now MPF is running, it's talking to the MC, and you have the world's most boring attract mode!

To quit MPF, just make sure the graphical window has focus and hit the ``Esc`` key. That should cause
both the MPF game engine and the MC to exit. (If they hang for some reason, you can click in the console
window of the one that's hanging and press ``CTRL+C`` to kill it.)

Note that in the screen shot above, I changed the properties of the command windows. The magenta window is
where I first ran ``mpf mc``, and the blue window is where I ran ``mpf``.

Since the *attract_started* slide only has one widget, and since all we did with that widget is
specify text (but not size, color, position, font, etc.), we just get the default text properties
which are small, arial, and white.

8. Launching the MPF game engine and MPF MC at the same time
------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous step, we used two separate console windows to launch ``mpf mc`` and ``mpf`` separately.
(If you do this, by the way, you can launch either one first and it will wait for the other one.)

That's nice for learning purposes, but kind of annoying for everyday use. Fortunately there's a command
called ``mpf both`` which launches both the game engine and the MC together.

Use it just like the others:

::

    C:\pinball\your_machine>mpf both

When you do this, you should see the graphical window pop up (most likely showing the *welcome_slide* for
a quick moment), then when the MPF game engine is up and running, you should see the graphical window
flip over to the *attract_started* slide. Here's a screen shot:

.. image:: 5_mpf_both.jpg

Check out the complete config.yaml file so far
----------------------------------------------

If you want to see a complete ``config.yaml`` file up to this point,
itâ€™s available in the "tutorials" folder of the mpf-examples
package that you should have downloaded in Step 1 of this tutorial.

There are config files for each step, so the config for Step 5 should
be at ``/mpf-examples/tutorial/config/step5.yaml``.

You can run this file directly by switching to that folder and then running the following command:

::

   C:\mpf-examples\tutorial>mpf -c step5

What if it doesn't work?
------------------------

If you can't get it to work, there are a few things to look at.

If you get some kind of "KeyError" like ``KeyError: 'welcome_slde'``, that means that it's looking
for something it didn't find. Most likely this is the slide player looking for a slide that doesn't
exist, so make sure the slide's entry in the ``slides:`` section matches the slide's name in the
``slide_player:`` section.

If the welcome slide works but you never see the attract slide, make sure you have the
``mode_attract_started:`` event name spelled properly. Also make sure you do *NOT* run MPF with the
``-b`` option since that tells it not to connect to the MC.

Most of the other errors should be pretty self-explanatory. If you get stuck, feel free to post
to the `mpf-users Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_.
