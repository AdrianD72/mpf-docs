display_(name)_initialized
==========================

*MPF Event*

The display called (name) has been initialized. This event is
posted in the MPF-MC only, not in MPF.

This event is part of the MPF-MC boot process and is not particularly
useful for game developers. If you want to show a "boot" slide as
early as possible, use the *mc_ready* event.
