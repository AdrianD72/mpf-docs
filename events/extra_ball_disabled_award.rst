extra_ball_disabled_award
=========================

*MPF Event*

Posted when you have the global extra ball settings set to not
enable extra balls but where an extra ball would have been awarded.
This is a good alternative event to use to score points or whatever
else you want to give the player when extra balls are disabled.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
