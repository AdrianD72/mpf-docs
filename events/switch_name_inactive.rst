switch_(name)_inactive
======================

*MPF Event*

Posted on MPF-MC only (e.g. not in MPF) when the MC receives
a BCP "switch" inactive command. Useful for video modes and graphical
menu navigation. Note that this is not posted for every switch all
the time, rather, only for switches that have been configured to
send events to BCP.
