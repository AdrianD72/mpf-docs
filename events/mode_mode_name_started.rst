mode_(mode_name)_started
========================

*MPF Event*

Posted when a mode has started. The "mode_name" part is replaced
with the actual name of the mode, so the actual event posted is
something like *mode_attract_started*, *mode_base_started*, etc.

This is posted after the "mode_(mode_name)_starting" event.
