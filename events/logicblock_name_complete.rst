logicblock_(name)_complete
==========================

*MPF Event*

The logic block called "name" has just been completed.

Note that this is the default completion event for logic blocks, but
this can be changed in a logic block's "events_when_complete:" setting,
so this might not be the actual event that's posted for all logic
blocks in your machine.
