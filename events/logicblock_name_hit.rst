logicblock_(name)_hit
=====================

*MPF Event*

The logic block "name" was just hit.

Note that this is the default hit event for logic blocks,
but this can be changed in a logic block's "events_when_hit:"
setting, so this might not be the actual event that's posted for
all logic blocks in your machine.
