award_lit_extra_ball
====================

*MPF Event*

This event will award an extra ball if extra ball is lit. If the
player has no lit extra balls, then this event will have no effect.

This is a good event to use in your extra ball mode or shot to post
to collect the lit extra ball. It will in turn post the
:doc:`extra_ball_awarded` event (assuming the player has not
exceeded any configured limits for max extra balls).

If you just want to award an extra ball regardless of whether the
player has one lit, use the :doc:`award_extra_ball` event instead.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
