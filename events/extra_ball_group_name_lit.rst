extra_ball_group_(name)_lit
===========================

*MPF Event*

An extra ball was just lit. This is a good event to use to
start your extra ball lit mode, to turn on an extra ball light,
to play the "get that extra ball" sound, etc.

Note that this event is posted if an extra ball is lit during play
and also when a player's turn starts if they have a lit extra ball.

See also the :doc:`extra_ball_lit_awarded` for a similar event that
is only posted when an extra ball is lit during play, and not
if the player starts their turn with the extra ball lit.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
