Adding widgets to a slide
=========================

Now that you know what widgets are, it's time to look at how you can actually
use them.

Option 1. Define widgets when you define a slide
------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to create and use widgets is to include them in the slide
configuration when the slide itself is created.

You can do this when you define a slide in the ``slides:`` section of your
config, or when you show a slide in the ``slide_player:`` section of your
config. See the :doc:`/displays/slides/creating_slides` guide for details.

Option 2. Use the "widget player"
---------------------------------

If you want to add a widget (or a groups of widgets) to an existing slide,
you can use the :doc:`/config/widget_player`. You can define your widgets
there, or you can use widgets that you've :doc:`pre-defined </reusable_widgets>`.
