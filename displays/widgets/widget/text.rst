Text Widget
===========

The text widget is used to show text on a slide. This widget is very powerful.

* You can configure dynamic text that is automatically updated (in real time)
  based on the value of a player variable or a machine variable.
* You can configure a placeholder "text string" that uses a lookup value to
  get its actual text. This is useful for things like multi-language support,
  or to be able to have different text strings based on a configuration file
  (family-friendly versus R-rated text, etc.)
