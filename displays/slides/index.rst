Slides
======

Now that you know what a display is, the next concept you need to understand is
"slides". In "slides" in MPF are just like slides in a PowerPoint presentation
or slides in an old-fashioned slide projector.

You create multiple slides (each with its own content), and then you tell an MPF
display which slide you want to show. Only one slide shows at a time, and you
can set "transitions" which control what visual effect is used to transition
from the current slide to the new slide. (Transitions are things like
cross-fade, move in, push out, etc.)
