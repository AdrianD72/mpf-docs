Brooks 'n Dunn
--------------

One of the projects we took on in 2015 was to rewire and build and MPF config for Gottlieb's Brooks 'n Dunn. (BnD).
BnD was the machine that Gottlieb was working on when they shut down in 1996.

This config is probably the most complete of any MPF project that's publicly available. However it contains lots of
licensed assets (music, videos, images, etc.) that are not in the public repo. This means you won't be able to
actually run it, but you can look through the configs (which are well commented) to see how we do things.

The BnD repo is at https://github.com/gabeknuth/bnd
