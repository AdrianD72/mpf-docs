Devices
=======

A *Device* is a "thing" in a pinball machine. (How's that for an explanation!)

In MPF, devices can be individual physical things (switches, LEDs, coils), or
they can be logical groupings of physical devices (Switch X plus Coil Y =
Flipper 1, etc.)

Devices can be configured in either machine-wide or mode-specific config files.
Every device has a name, and there configuration options for each device which
control exactly how it behaves (or how its behavior changes depending on
what's going on in your game).

Devices in MPF include:
