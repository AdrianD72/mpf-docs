Pinball Mechanisms
==================

MPF supports all the various pinball hardware mechanisms you'd expect. Some of
these are basic (switches, LEDs, coils), and others are built up by combining
multiple simpler mechs (Switch X plus Coil Y = Flipper 1, etc.)

Pinball mechs can be configured in either machine-wide or mode-specific config files.
Each one has a name, and there are configuration options for each which
control exactly how it behaves (or how its behavior changes depending on
what's going on in your game).

Pinball Mechs in MPF include:
