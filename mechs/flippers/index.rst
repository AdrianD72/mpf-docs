Flippers
========

Flippers are probably the first thing you think of when you think about building
your own pinball machine. In fact when most people get their own hardware and
start drilling holes in a piece of plywood, the first visible thing they do is
to get their flippers flipping.

MPF has support for lots of different kinds of flippers (as there are many
different ways they've been wired over the years), as well as a lot of different
options for how flippers are fine tuned.

MPF also has support for various "novelty" flipper modes (no-hold flippers,
reversed flipper buttons, weak flippers, etc.)

We recommend you read the two sections in "Flipper Concepts" before you start
configuring the flippers in your machine.
