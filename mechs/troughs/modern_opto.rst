How to configure a modern trough with opto switches
===================================================

TODO

Most modern troughs also have a switch (or opto) in the upper position near the
exit that's used to detect if a ball falls back into the trough from the "exit"
sideâ€”something that tends to happen if your eject coil pulse is too
strong or too weak. (Too weak means the ball falls back in because it
didn't have enough oomph to make it out, and too strong means the ball
flies out too fast, bounces off the right edge rail of the plunger
lane, and lands back in the trough after the other balls have rolled
down into their new positions.)

In MPF we refer to this as a "jam" switch, though it's also called a "ball
stacked" or "up ball" switch depending on whose manual you're reading.
