Believe it or not, the playfield in MPF is technically a :doc:`ball device </mechs/ball_devices/index>`.
This is needed since MPF wants to know where all the balls are at all
times, so it needs to know which balls are "in" the playfield device.

:doc:`TODO: Add a picture of a playfield </about/help_us_to_write_it>`

The playfield is also responsible for tracking balls that
"disappeared" from it without going into other devicesâ€”-a process which
kicks off the :doc:`ball search </game_logic/ball_search/index>`.
The default playfield ball device (called
*playfield*) is created automatically based on settings in the
``mpfconfig.yaml`` default configuration file. Most machines only have
one playfield, though if you have a mini-playfield or a head-to-head
machine then you can configure additional playfield devices.

Playfields are configured in the :doc:`playfields: section </config/playfields>`
of the configuration file.

Monitorable Properties
