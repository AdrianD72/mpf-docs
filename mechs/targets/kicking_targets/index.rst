Mission Pinball Framework's (MPF) *kicking target* device represents a switch in a pinball machine. This device is
used for kicking targets with a coil for kicking. Used rarely, these targets look like stationary targets, but when
hit they kick the back in the opposite direction much like a slingshot or bumper.
