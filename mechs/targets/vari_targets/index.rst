Mission Pinball Framework's (MPF) *vari target* device represents a switch in a pinball machine. It is a metal arm
that pivots under the playfield and awards a scoring value associated with it that changes depending on how hard
the ball hits it. Typically the harder the ball hit the more points awarded.
