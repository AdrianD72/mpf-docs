Specifying Colors in Config Files
=================================

Colors in the MPF-MC can be specified by name (like "red") or by hex value ("ff0000"). Note that if you
specify a color by hex value, do NOT put a ``#`` in it, since YAML files use those for comments which
are ignored. RIGHT: ``color: ff0000``  WRONG: ``color: #ff0000``
