led_stripes
===========

*Config File Section*

.. versionadded:: 0.31

A "led_stripe" will create "count" leds for you starting the number at "number_start". If you need a prefix or suffix for the number you can use "number_template". All settings in "led_template" will be applied to all LEDs. The only difference between :doc:`led_stripes </config/led_stripes>`  and :doc:`led_stripes </config/led_rings>` is how the x/y coordinates are computed.
