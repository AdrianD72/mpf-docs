Abstract devices
================

Abstract devices are logical devices in MPF that are based on concepts
rather than physical devices, though they are created and managed just
like physical and logical devices, so they're included here for
completeness. For example, a ball saver in MPF is a "ball saver"
device. You might actually have several ball savers in your machine,
each running based on different conditions and with different
settings. (And maybe multiple ball savers will run at the same time.)
You might have a regular ball saver which is active for 10 seconds
after a ball starts which flashes the shoot again light, but you might
also have one shot that always drains straight down the middle which
could have a phantom (unadvertised) ball saver attached to it. There
are also abstract devices for things like multiball and ball locks
(whether physical or virtual).
