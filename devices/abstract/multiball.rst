MPF includes a *multiball* abstract device which can be used to
automatically start and stop multiballs.


Configuring multiballs

See the `multiballs: </config/multiballs>`_ section of the configuration file reference.

Events posted by multiball devices

Multiball devices post several events when they are enabled or disabled, and when
they start and stop. See the `:doc:</events>`_ for details.
(Look for event names that start with "multiball".)
