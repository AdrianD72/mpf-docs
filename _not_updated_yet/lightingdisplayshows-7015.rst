MPF uses the concept of “shows” to control a sequence of actions that
take place. Since MPF is actually two separate processes (the core
game engine and the media controller), there are actually two
different kinds of shows that run in each process.


+ Hardware Shows are sequences of hard actions, including lights,
  LEDs, flashers, drivers, and/or GI effects.
+ Media Shows are sequences of slides, videos, movies, images, and/or
  sounds.


The general concepts and file formats are similar for both kinds of
shows. For example, hardware shows are sequences of lights, LEDs,
coils, flashers, and GI actions. Shows can be long or short, simple or
complex. You can have multiple shows running at the same time, and you
can start and stop individual shows while others are running. You can
create playlists of shows so that multiple shows are linked together
to play back-to-back.
