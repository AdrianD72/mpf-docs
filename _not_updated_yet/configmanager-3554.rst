MPF's *config manager* is responsible for loading, parsing,
processing, and validating the settings in config files which MPF uses
for your machine-wide and mode-specific configurations. Even though we
make a big deal about how you can do 90%+ of your game "programming"
via config files, it's not actually necessary to do so. (If you want
to use MPF but want to setup everything in Python code instead of
using the config files, that's fine by us!) But if you do choose to
use config files, MPF's config manager is what makes that happen.
