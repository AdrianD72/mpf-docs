We have written many times that you don't have to be a "real"
programmer in order to get a pinball machine up and running with MPF.
We built this config file interface. There's a misconception that with
MPF, you have to learn this proprietary config interface and that's
more complex than writing your own game code in Python. After all,
with Python, your skills are transferable! You have to decide if you
want to build a pinball machine, or you want to learn Python.
