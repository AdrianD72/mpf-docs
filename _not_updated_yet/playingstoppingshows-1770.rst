Once you'vecreated your show files and entered them into your
configuration file so MPF will load them, the next step is to actually
play your shows.



Background on how MPF handles show playback
-------------------------------------------

Before we get into the specifics of playing shows, let's look at some
important concepts about how MPF handles playing shows.



You can play multiple shows at the same time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, understand that it ispossible to play multiple shows at the
same time. This makes it easy to break down complex shows into a bunch
of smaller, simpler shows which just play at the same time. For
example, take a look at this Judge Dredd attract mode light show that
has a lot going on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C4ivRWPeMU At
first you might think this is crazily complex, but it's actually 7
simple shows which all happen to be playing at once. The back-and-
forth "sweep" of the chain lights is one show, the "sweep" of the
J-U-D-G-E drop target lights is another show, the rainbow cycling of
the perp lights is a third show, the DMD display is its own show, etc.
So just by making all these simple little shows and playing them all
at once, we can make something that looks complex but that's really
easy. (Plus if you break your shows into lots of little shows, you can
use those smaller shows in other places throughout your game.) When
you play multiple shows at once, you can start and stop individual
ones as you wish. So when the machine is in attract mode, you might
have one show going in a loop for the display, and then you have a
bunch of shows for some playfield lights, then after awhile you switch
up the playfield to a different light show, but you can keep the
display show running untouched.



Shows run at different "priorities" which is how they handle conflict
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you play a show, one of the options you can specify is the
"priority" that show will play at. (If you don't specify a priority,
the show will play at Priority 0.) This priority controls what happens
if two different shows want to control the same thingat the same time.
So if one show is running at Priority 0 and is flashing an LED red,
and another show running at Priority 2 wants that LED to be blue, well
then that LED will be blue. After the higher priority show doesn't
need that device anymore, it will be restored to whatever any running
lower priority show wants it to be. For display shows, the running
priority of a show affects what priority the slides are that it puts
on the display. The display will only show the slides from the show if
they're the same or higher priority than whatever slide it's showing
at that moment.



You can't run a show faster than your machine loop rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that since the showcontroller is completely controlled by your
game code, you can't run a show faster than your `machine tickHZ
rate`_. This doesn't mean that your tocks_per_second can't be faster
that your game loop. It just means that if it is then showactions at
each step will not actually be executed until the next game loop. For
example, if you have a machine loop rate of 30HZ, and you have shows
playing at 1000 tocks_per_sec, that's fine as long as each step in
your show is at least 33 (or so) tocks. So if you have steps that are
playing 100ms apart, this will work fine since your 30HZ machine loop
can easily handle a show which has 100ms between steps. If this all
sounds confusing, then just play it safe by not playing shows faster
than your machine loop rate. :)



Playing and Stopping Shows: 3 different options
-----------------------------------------------

There are several ways to play (and stop) shows (once they've been
loaded) in MPF, including:


+ The `ShowPlayer:` section of the machine configuration file.
+ Posting show start and stop action events.
+ Manually in code.




Playing shows via the config file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make entries in your machine configuration files which cause
shows to stop and start based on different `MPF events`_. For example,
you can start playing the attract mode light shows and display show
when the attract mode starting event is posted, and then when a the
game starting event is posted, you can stop those shows and start a
display show with includes the player's ball number and score. Details
for how to start and stop shows via the config file are available in
the ``ShowPlayer:` section`_ of the configuration file reference. Note
that all of the various show options mentioned there are covered in
the `Show Settings page`_.



Posting show start and stop action events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also play and stop shows via the action events
`action_play_show` and `action_stop_show`. (`What are action
events?`_) You can pass any of the standard show settings(covered
`here`_)when starting or stopping a show via an action event. This is
nice if you want to play or stop shows via `Logic Blocks`_.



Playing shows via code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also play and stop shows via codeâ€”whether it's code you add
into a Scriptlet or if you're writing something custom. Once you've
loaded a show, you play it with the show's play() method, like this:


::

    
    self.machine.shows['rainbow_show'].play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=4, priority=3, blend=True)


You can stop a running show via its stop() method, like this:


::

    
    self.machine.shows['rainbow_show'].stop()


Again, the specific keyword parameters you can use when playing and
stopping shows is covered in the `Show Settings page`_, which we'll
look at now.
