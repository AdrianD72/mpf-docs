The MPF package includes a built-in high score mode that can be used
to track high scores, including letting players enter their names (or
initials) and tracking different high score awards. See the `How To:
High Scores`_ guide for details. The high score mode stores its high
scores in *<your_machine_folder>/data/high_scores.yaml* file. It
automatically reads them in when MPF boots to create machine variables
that can be accessed from your game, and it automatically updates the
high scores on disk when they change after a game ends.
