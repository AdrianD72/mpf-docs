The *playfield_transfers:* section of the machine-wide config file is
where you configure `playfield transfer devices`_. This section *can*
be used in your machine-wide config files. This section *cannot* be
used in mode-specific config files. Here's an example configuration:


::

    
    playfield_transfers:
        tube:
            ball_switch: pf_tube
            captures_from: playfield
            eject_targets: lower_playfield


Settings for *playfield_transfers* include:



ball_switch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the switch that, when activated, means that the ball has
just transferred from the *captures_from:* playfield to the
*eject_targets:* playfield.



eject_targets:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



captures_from:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
