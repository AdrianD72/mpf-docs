The switch player plugin is used to automatically "play" a sequence of
switch events into MPF. This is useful for testing since it means you
can write switch sequences which always play back in the same way, and
it's easier to get deep into the game without having to set up an OSC
client or set up complex key mappings. Then you can add specific
switch step entries in the in ` `switchplayer:` section`_ of your
config file.
