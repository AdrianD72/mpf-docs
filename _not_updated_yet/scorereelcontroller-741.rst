The Mission Pinball Framework supports EM-style mechanical score reels
for anyone brave enough to convert an EM machine to modern digital
control. (`We're doing this`_ with a 1974 Gottlieb Bit Shot.) Since
this is something that most people won't care about, we won't waste
too much time talking about it here in the documentation. But if
you're interested, `check out the blog post we wrote`_ with the full
details. Mechanical score reels are managed via the Score Reel
Controller (in the score_reel.py module)andconfigured in the `Score
Reels section of the machine configuration files`_. One final note:
The score reel support is built into the framework and available on
any machine running MPF, so there's nothing stopping you from building
an EM score reel topper for a modern machine like Attack From Mars and
giving it some mechanical scoring love. (You'd need about 12 digits of
course, but it would work! :) Anyone? Anyone??
