The Mission Pinball Framework is extensible, meaning you can easily
add your own code or modules without having to "hack" the core code.
When you download the framework, it includes several plugins for
things you might find useful right out of the box. You're free to use
these as is, to customize or extend them, or to replace them
altogether with your own. Built-in plugin modules include:


+ OSC . An interface to control a pinball machine from an iOS or
  Android device.
+ Auditor . Records game, player, and switch audit information to a
  log file.
+ Info Lights . Lights up backbox lights based on different game and
  player events. (Typically found in EM machines.)


We have several plugins in the works which we will include soon,
including:


+ Ball Save . Gives the player another ball if they lose it too
  quickly.
+ Ball Search . Looks for missing and stuck pinballs.
+ ServiceMenu . An mode for operators and owners to change machine
  settings.
+ Credit . Handles coins, dollars, and tokens.
+ Switch Recorder . Lets you record and "play back" switch events from
  one game for repeat testing.
+ Test Mode . Lets you test coils, lights, and switches.
+ High Score . Manages and tracks high scores.
+ Valid Playfield . Used to track whether a ball launch was
  successful.
