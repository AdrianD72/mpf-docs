This page explains how to install MPF (and all the related components)
on Linux. Our all-in-one Debian installer can be used for any Debian-
based flavor of Linux, including Debian derivatives like Unbuntu,
Xubuntu, etc. This installer works with x86, x86-64-bit, and ARM-based
systems (Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, ODROID, etc.). This script
will give you the option to also install the drivers for the P-ROC and
P3-ROC. (The drivers that FAST Pinball controllers need are built-in
to Debian.)


#. Download the `installer zip file`_.
#. Unzip it
#. Run `./install`.
#. Answer the few questions...
