The MPF media controller is included in the core MPF package. You run
it from the command line via `python mc.py *your_machine*`.The files
that make up the built-in media controller are in the
`/mpf/media_controller` folder. Everything we cover in the tutorial,
how to guides, and this documentation is based on this built-in media
controller. It can drive LCD and DMD-based displays and play multi-
track audio. All of its configuration is done via the config files.
