MPF's FadeCandy interface is used when you want to control RGB LEDs
connected to a FadeCandy LED controller. You can mix-and-match the
FadeCandy platform with others (e.g. you can use a P-ROC for coils and
switches and a FadeCandy for LEDs), and you can even mix-and-match
LEDs in a machine (e.g. if you want 512 LEDs, you can use the FAST
Controller to drive 256 of them and a FadeCandy to drive the other
256). Details on how to configure MPF for the FadeCandy are in `this
How To guide`_.
