The *system11:* section of the machine-wide config file contains
settings which control how MPF works with System 11 machines. See the
`How To guide for System 11 machines`_ for details of this interface.
This sectioncan be used in your machine-wide config files. This

        ac_relay_delay_ms: 75
        ac_relay_driver_number: c14




ac_relay_delay_ms:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of milliseconds MPF waits before and after flipping the A/C
select relay to allow for it to fully switch positions. Default is
*75ms*.



ac_relay_driver_number:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver (with a “C” added to it) from the operator's manual of your
System 11 machine which controls the A/C select relay. Note that this
relay is labeled differently in different manuals. Sometimes it's
called the *A/C Select Relay*, and sometimes it’s called the *Solenoid
Select Relay*.
