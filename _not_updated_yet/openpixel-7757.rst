MPF's Open Pixel interface is used when you want to control RGB LEDs
connected to a Open Pixel Controller LED controller. You can mix-and-
match the Open Pixel platform with others (e.g. you can use a P-ROC
for coils and switches and a Open Pixel for LEDs), and you can even
mix-and-match LEDs in a machine (e.g. if you want 512 LEDs, you can
use the FAST Controller to drive 256 of them and a Open Pixel to drive
the other 256). Details on how to configure MPF for the Open Pixel are
in `this How To guide`_. (The linked How To guide is for the
FadeCandy, which is a type of Open Pixel Control LED controller. MPF
has a separate platform interface for the FadeCandy since the
FadeCandy has some advanced features, but that How To guide can be
used for general Open Pixel Control devices too.)
