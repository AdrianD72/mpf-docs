Warning! We're getting ready to release the next version of MPF
(0.30), and as part of that * we've already updated this page with
information that only applies to 0.30 *. The current (master) version
of MPF is 0.21. This means if you're using MPF 0.21, the content of
this page does not apply to the version of MPF you're using. If you
want to get the documentation that does apply to MPF 0.21, you can
download a PDF of it `here`_. If you'd like to experiment with the
next (dev) version of MPF, we have a `How To guide describing how to
upgrade from MPF 0.21 to MPF 0.30 here`_. However we haven't finished
merging all the changes together, and we're not done with the
documentation yet, so it might be tricky. We expect to have MPF 0.30
released soon, along with all the documentation updated. This message
was last updated on Sunday, March 13, 2016.
