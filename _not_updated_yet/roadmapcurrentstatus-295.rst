Near Term Goals to get us to "v1"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a list of everything we have to get finished up to get us to
what we'll call our "1.0" version. (Our goal is to release MPF 1.0 at
some point in 2015) :


+ Create a single effects controller to handle synchronization of
  light shows, sounds, and display content. (Right now these are all
  handled separately.)
+ Segmented displays
+ Operator mode / service menu
+ Bad switch handling
+ Status display (show info when both flipperbuttons are held in)
+ Flipper codes
+ Match
+ Bonus Mode (We have a how to guide which shows how to do it with
  code. We need to create a version based on config files.)
+ Servo / stepper / motor support
+ A proper installer and inclusion in PyPI
+ Move our graphics and sound off of Pygame and onto SDL2.
+ A graphical-based "pinball builder" tool which lets you setup MPF
  graphically.
+ A graphical playfield tool that lets you see lights and activate
  switches on your computer screen.
