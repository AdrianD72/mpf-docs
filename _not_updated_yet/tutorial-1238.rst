So you want to write your own software fora pinball machine? Awesome!
(Hopefully you're a little crazy, but seriously, this is awesome.
Congrats!) We're going to attempt to outline everything you need to do
to get the Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) up and running on your
machine. It's easy, even if you're not a computer programmer! Just
keep in mind that MPF is very much a work in progress (as is this
tutorial). We're not even to "v1" yet. But we've tried to document how
to get up and running as best we can. Here's how this process works:


#. Follow all the steps in the tutorial, in order. (Each step builds
   on the previous one, and every machine needs the things from every
   step.) This will give you a basic, playable game, complete with multi-
   player support, and attract mode, lights, shots, points, and a basic
   game mode.
#. When you're done with the tutorial, browse our `How To guides`_.
   (These are like the "cook book" or "recipe" approach.) The How To
   guides can be followed in whatever order you want, and you don't have
   to do all of them.


By the way, this is tutorial outlines the exact process we follow
ourselves whenever we walk up to a new machine to get MPF running. We
literally open the documentation to this page and follow along! ` `_
