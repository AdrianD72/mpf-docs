A *playfield transfer* device in MPF is a device that is used to
transfer balls from one playfield to another in machines that have
multiple playfields. This device is needed when the playfields are
directly connected without a proper ball device in between. For
example, sometimes a tube connecting two playfields will have a switch
in it that's activated as the ball rolls through, letting MPF know
that the source playfield has lost a ball and the destination
playfield has gained a ball. *Playfield transfers* are configured in
the playfield_transfers: section of the machine config file.
