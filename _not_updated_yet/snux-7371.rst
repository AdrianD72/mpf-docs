The *snux:* section of your machine config file lets you configure
settings for the Snux driver board for System 11 machines. (What's the
Snux driver board? See our `How To guide for System 11 machines`_ for
details.) This sectioncan be used in your machine-wide config files.
This section *cannot* be used in mode-specific config files. This
*snux* configuration is included in the *mpfconfig.yaml* template file
and shouldn't have to be included in your own machine's config.
