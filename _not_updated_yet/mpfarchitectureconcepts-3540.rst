This section of the documentation explains all the nitty-gritty
details of how MPF works. You don't necessarily have to read this to
get started with MPF, as you can get a running pinball machine just by
following the tutorial and various how to guides. But as some point
you'll probably want to dig into the architecture of the various
components of MPF, so that's what we'll do here.
