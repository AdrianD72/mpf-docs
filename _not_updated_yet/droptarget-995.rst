Drop Target devices in the Mission Pinball Framework inherit all the
features and functions of `regular targets`_ with additional
functionality for reset and knockdown coils. You can group multiple
drop targets together into a Drop Target Bank, giving you
functionality to query how many of the targets are currently complete,
to reset the entire group, and to post events and run shows when the
bank is complete.
