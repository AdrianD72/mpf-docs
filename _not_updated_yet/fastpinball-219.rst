` `_ The`FAST Pinball`_controllers are createdby Aaron Davis and Dave
Beecher from Seattle. FAST has threemodelsâ€”the *FAST WPC
Controller,*the *FAST Core Controller*, and the *FAST Nano
Controller*. The *FAST WPC Controller* is used when you want to write
your own game code for existing Williams WPC machines. It replaces the
original Williams WPC MPU board andleverages the existing Williams
driver board and wiring harnesses. The FAST *Core* and *Nano*
Controllers areused with new machines. The two controllers are
similar. The Core is a big bigger and has support for physical DMDs,
and an attachment for a BeagleBone Black. Choose it if you want to
have a physical DMD, otherwise the Nano Controller is fine. (Any of
the FAST controllers can be used with an LCD to create a virtual DMD
if you want that style of display in your machine.) If you want to use
a FAST Pinball controller for your MPF machine, our `all-in-one
installers`_ (as well as our manual installation instructions) will
install the driver you need.
