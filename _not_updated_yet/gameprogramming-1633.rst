When it comes time to program your game, here's the basic high-level
steps you can follow:


#. Follow the `step-by-step tutorial`_. When you finish that, you'll
   have all your hardware defined and a basic functioning game with a
   base game mode and basic display.
#. Browse through the `"How To" guides`_ which will give you step-by-
   step instructions to build additional things we didn't cover in the
   initial tutorial.
#. Start building your `game logic & rules`_.
#. If you need to add custom Python code to extend what you can do
   with config files alone, read our intro to custom code first.
