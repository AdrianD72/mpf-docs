A flasher is just a really bright light that's controlled by a driver
circuit instead of a light circuit. (Driver circuits are used since
they are controlled by MOSFETs that can support more voltage than the
low-voltage lighting circuits.) Most flashers run at 24vdc. Even
though flashers are really no different than coils under the hood, MPF
treats flashers as their own types of devices so you can use more
"light-centric" commands for them. You can also include flashers in
shows, meaning you can coordinate complex flasher actions with your
existing light shows. Configure your flashers in the ``Flashers:`
section`_ of your machine configuration file.
