MPF has been tested on several different existing machines. In doing
so, we have baseline MPF hardware configurations built for the
following machines. Note that these are not complete games. In fact
some of these were only built in a few hours and have nothing more
than the hardware configuration. But if you're interested in using MPF
on any of these machines, contact us and we can send you the relevant
configuration files you can use as a starting point. Also if you've
used MPF on any other machines and you're willing to share your
configuration files, please let us know! Williams WPC
