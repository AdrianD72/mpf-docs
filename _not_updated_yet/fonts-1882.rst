The Mission Pinball Framework uses regular TrueType fonts to render
text for the on screen window display as well as for the DMD. As a
game designer, you collect the `.ttf` font files you want and put them
into your game folder. Then if you ever copy your game files to
another computer, the fonts go with them. Part of your role as a game
designer is to pick the fonts that you want to use and then to
configure them so that they look good in a pinball machine. (This is
especially important for DMDs since they have limited color and
resolution.) When you're ready to start thinking about fonts, there
are several resources for you:


+ A `step-by-step guide`_ detailing how to add TrueType fonts into
  your machine.
+ Instructions for the "`Font Tester`_" graphical tool we built which
  you can use to see which fonts (and with which settings) will look
  best on your DMD.
+ The configuration file reference documentation for the ` `fonts:`
  section`_ of your config file, which is where you actually enter your
  font configuration information.
