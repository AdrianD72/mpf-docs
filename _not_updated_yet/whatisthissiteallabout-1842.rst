Welcome to MissionPinball.com. We are Brian Madden and Gabe Knuth ,
and we're the creators of the Mission Pinball Framework, a free and
open source pinball software framework you can use to create your own
game software for real pinball machines.



If you want to write your own software for a pinball machine:
-------------------------------------------------------------

We are creating open source pinball software called the Mission
Pinball Framework (MPF) you can use to replace the software on an
existing pinball machine, or to power a new custom pinball machine.
Read about it `here`_. MPF is 100% free and open source. You can do
whatever you want with it, and you don't have to pay us anything.



If you need help getting started with MPF:
------------------------------------------

Read our `step-by-step tutorial`_ which walks you through downloading
and playing with MPF. You don't even need a real pinball machine! You
can do everything on your computer to get started.



How do you get the MPF software installed on a real pinball machine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You need a modern pinball controller which you install into the
machine which then interfaces with a computer running MPF. We don't
sell those, but you can buy them from `Multimorphic`_ (the P-ROC
system) or `FAST Pinball`_. Then you can use our MPF software to
control them. More info `here`_.



If you get stuck or have questions:
-----------------------------------

We have a `support forum`_ on this website where you can post
questions. We'll get an email notification of your question and we'll
respond as quickly as we can.



If you're interested in our conversion of a 1974 EM pinball machine to
modern solid state control from Expo 2014:
------------------------------------------

We took a 1974 Gottlieb Big Shot electro-mechanical (EM) pinball
machine and converted it to modern digital control. You can read about
that in a `series of blog posts`_ we did about it.
