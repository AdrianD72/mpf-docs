` `_ The P-ROC and P3-ROC are hardware controllers created by Gerry
Stellenberg of Austin, Texas-based `Multimorphic`_. The P-ROC
controller is a "drop in" replacement in existing WPC and Stern
machines, whereas as the P3-ROC controller is designed for new
machines. Multimorphic also has custom driver and interface boards
that can be used for new machines with either controller. MPFsupports
both the P3-ROC and the P-ROC. (MPF supports the P-ROC operating with
P-ROC driver boards as well as with Williams WPC and Stern S.A.M.
driver boards. We haven't tested with a Stern Whitestar machine yet
but it should work. Contact us for details if you'd like to help us
test!) More information about these controller boards (and ordering
information) is available at`pinballcontrollers.com`_. They also have
an active`forum`_and`wiki`_.



Using a P-ROC or P3-ROC with the MPF
------------------------------------

If you want to use a P-ROC or P3-ROC for your MPF machine, our `all-
in-one installers`_ (as well as our manual installation instructions)
will install all the drivers and support libraries you need. You don't
need to deal with building and compiling libpinproc and pypinproc as
outlined on the pinballcontrollers.com website because we have done
that for you with our installers.
