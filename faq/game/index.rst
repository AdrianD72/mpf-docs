FAQ: Building your game
=======================

Where do I get help building my machine?
----------------------------------------

If you're looking for information about physically building your machine, check out the
`PinballMakers.com <http://pinballmakers.com>`_ website.

I want to do something that's not in MPF. Now what?
---------------------------------------------------

Awesome!

First, you can check out the list of new features that we're tracking.

* `MPF New Features <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+feature%22>`_
* `MPF-MC New Features <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-mc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+feature%22>`_
* `MPF Monitor New Features <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-monitor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+feature%22>`_

If you see your feature there, you can click on it and then click the "Subscribe" button to receive email
notifications of progress or when it's been added.

You can also read our :doc:`/versions/roadmap` for an idea of our longer-term plans for MPF.

If you still don't see your idea, of you'd like to talk about it or ask questions, feel free to post
a message to the `MPF Users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`.
