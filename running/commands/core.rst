mpf core (command-line utility)
===============================

Runs the MPF "core" modules without any game logic. This feature has not been fully implemented yet, but it's being put
in place to facilitate using the MPF platform interface to be completely controlled by external sources such as PinMAME.

Note that in early dev versions of MPF 0.30, ``mpf core`` was used to launch the MPF game engine. That command has been
replaced with ``mpf game``.
