MPF license & copyright
=======================

The Mission Pinball Framework code and all documentation is licensed in a way
that basically means you can do whatever you want with it. The only real caveat
is that you use it at your own risk, and we don't provide any warranties.

The code is licensed under the `MIT <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_
license, and the documentation is licensed via
`Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_.

It a nutshell, you can use MPF and the docs however you want. You can use MPF
in a commercial product. You can make changes to it, and you don't have to share
the changes back with the community if you don't want to. You can make
derivative works, sell it, build a business on it, etc. Go nuts!

At the end of the day, we created MPF because we want to see more pinball in
the world, so we didn't put any restrictions on what you can do with it because
we don't want anyone to hesitate jumping into the amazing world of pinball!
