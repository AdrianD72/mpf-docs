MPF has support for extra balls. Extra balls in MPF are "named", and they're
tracked so that (by default) each extra ball can only be awarded once. You can
configure as many different extra balls as you want, each with different
settings that tie into the events that award them.

The extra ball functionality is fairly basic at the moment, but we have plans
to add things like maximum number of extra balls, settings to enable or disable
extra balls, settings to award points instead of extra balls, etc.
