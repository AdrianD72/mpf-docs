MPF includes support for high scores which is where players can enter their
names (or initials) when they've achieved a high score. Features include:

+ Set any player variable as a high score option. So in addition to
  score you could set high score entries for loops, ramps, aliens
  destroyed, etc.
+ Set how many of each high score type are tracked (Top 5 for high
  scores, Top 3 for loops, Top 1 for aliens, etc.)
+ Set what each “award name” is called. (The highest score is “GRAND
  CHAMPION,” the second highest score is “HIGH SCORE 1”, the highest
  loop score is “MAJOR LOOPER”, etc.)
+ How many characters a player can enter for their name.
+ A list of valid characters the player can choose from
+ The layout of the display for entering their names and show their
  rewards.
+ Events for high score awards and entry, so you can configure
  high score entry screens.
