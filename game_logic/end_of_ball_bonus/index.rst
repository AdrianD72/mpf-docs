End of Ball Bonus
=================

MPF contains a built-in end of ball bonus mode and feature which you can use
to calculate and display a player's bonus score when they drain a ball.

The built-in bonus mode can handle bonus scoring, multipliers, awarding points
based on any player variables, and other "standard" things. You can also
extend and enhance it if you have specific requirements that aren't covered by
the built-in mode.
