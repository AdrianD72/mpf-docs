Tools
=====

There are several tools which have been created to help you build your game in MPF.

:doc:`MPF Monitor <monitor/index>`
----------------------------------

The MPF Monitor is a graphical utility you can use to interact with a running instance of MPF. See lights
change in action, click to control switches, and lay out everything on an image of your playfield.

:doc:`"Interactive" MC (or "iMC") <imc/index>`
----------------------------------------------

The interactive MC lets you create YAML configurations for slides and widgets in realtime and see them
on a display. This is great for fine tuning and tweaking your slides.
