Interactive MC (iMC)
====================

The MPF MC package includes an "interactive" MC.

When you run this, it runs the MC like normal loading the config files like normal. However instead of running
the regular MPF, it runs a special version that lets you type slide & widget configs and then "send" them to the
MC. The idea is you can use this tool to keep tweaking and fine-tuning your slide and widget settings in a way that's
much easier than starting your game and going through your game to find the slide you're looking for.

Since this tool uses the regular MC and the regular config files, you have access to all the named widgets, images,
videos, styles, fonts, etc. from your MPF machine config.

Note that the iMC does not connect to physical hardware.
