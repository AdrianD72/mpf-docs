(logic_block)_step
==================

*MPF player variable*

The default player variable name that's used to store the
current step for a sequence player variable. Note that the (logic_block) part of the
player variable name is replaced with the actual logic block's name.

Also note that it's possible to override the player variable name
that's used by default and to specify your own name. You do this in the
``player_variable:`` part of the logic block config.
