(shot)_(profile)
================

*MPF player variable*

The profile step (starting with 0) this profile is in for this
shot. The actual name of the player variable is the name
(shot)_(profile). For example, if you have a
shot called "right_ramp" and a profile called "flash", the current
step the profile is at for that shot will be stored in a player
variable called ``right_ramp_flash``.

Note that you can override this default player variable name with the
"player_variable" setting in a shot profile.
