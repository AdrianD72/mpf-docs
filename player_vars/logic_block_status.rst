(logic_block)_status
====================

*MPF player variable*

The default player variable name that's used to store the
accrual state for an accrual player variable. Note that the (logic_block)
part of the player variable name is replaced with the actual logic
block's name.

Also note that it's possible to override the player variable name
that's used by default and to specify your own name. You do this in the
``player_variable:`` part of the logic block config.
