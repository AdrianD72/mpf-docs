How to Guides ("Cookbook" Recipes)
==================================

We've created a bunch of "How To" guides to walk you through adding
very specific things to your game. Our intention is that you'll first
follow the :doc:`step-by-step tutorial </tutorial/index>` (in order) to get to the point
where you have a very basic running game, and then you can pick-and-
choose the specific How To guides you'd like to do next. The How To
guides are self-contained and can be done in any order.

Note: We used to put all the How To guides here in this "how to" section of
the documentation, however, that was confusing because it meant the how to
guides for a particular part of MPF were not in the same place as the rest of
the documentation for that area.

So we moved the How To guides into their respective sections. For example, the
How To guides for sounds and audio are now incorporated into the "Sounds &
Audio" section of the documentation.
