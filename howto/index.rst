How to Guides ("Cookbook" Recipes)
==================================

Older versions of the MPF documentation include a "How To" or "Cookbook /
Recipes" section of the documentation that gave step-by-step examples of how to
do different things with MPF.

The problem was the organization was confusing, because the How To guide were
not located in the same section as the regular documentation for each different
part of MPF.

In other words, if you wanted to know how to animate a widget, were you supposed
to look in the "Widgets" part of the documentation, or in the How To guides?

So now we're consolidated the documentation so that all the how to guides in
the main sections of the documentation. For example, the guide which explains
how to do widget animations is in the "Displays, DMDs & Graphics" section, then
the "Widgets" section under there.
