I2C Platforms in MPF
====================

The following platforms allow controlling I2C devices in MPF:

* :doc:`Linux Nativ I2C <smbus/index>` - If your linux PC has a driver for the I2C interface it will work in MPF
* :doc:`P3-Roc <multimorphic/index>` (but not the P-Roc)
* :doc:`Raspberry Pi <rpi/index>` - Remote via network or locally using pigpio
