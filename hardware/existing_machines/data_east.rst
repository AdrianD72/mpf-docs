Controlling Data East Machines
==============================

Data east machines can be controlled using the
:doc:`SNUX System 11 board </hardware/snux/index>` connected to any WPC
controller such as the :doc:`Multimorphic P-ROC </hardware/multimorphic/index>`
(not the P3-ROC). This is similar to :doc:`system11`.
