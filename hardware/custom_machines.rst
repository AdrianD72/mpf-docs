Controlling a custom "home brew" machine with MPF
=================================================
If you want to use the
MPF to power a new *custom* pinball machine that you build yourself, you can buy
new custom driver boards from the same people who make the P-ROC orFAST Pinball
controllers. (These P-ROC or FASTdriver boards are typically only used with
custom machines, because if you're replacing the main CPU board in an existing
machine then it's easiest to just use the existing driver boards as they are.
i.e. there's no need to rewire anything.) The important takeaway is that
hardware controllers from FAST & P-ROC can control the original Williams/Stern
driver boards or their own custom driver boards. (More on that in a bit too.)
