MPF compatible control systems / hardware
=========================================

MPF controls a pinball machine by interfacing to a modern pinball control system.
(See the :doc:`/start/index` for details.) MPF itself is hardware-independent,
meaning that MPF (and the configs and code you build) can work with lots of
different kinds of control systems and hardware devices.

Not only does this give you a choice of what type of pinball control hardware
you want to use, it also means that you have the flexibility to change your
hardware at any time without having to change any game code. You could
even release a game code update that works on multiple platformsâ€”-all with the
same code!

`Here's a demo video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zw_cHw2CXY>`_ of us
switching out a P-ROC controller for a FAST controller in 3 minutes and
running the same game code on both.

It's possible to mix-and-match multiple types of hardware in a single
MPF machine config. For example, you could combine the SmartMatrix RGB DMD with
a FAST Core controller, or a FadeCandy LED controller with a P-ROC, etc.)

MPF currently supports the following hardware control systems. We are always adding
more, so if there's a hardware device that you'd like to use that we don't support,
let us know. (Or better yet, write your own interface to it and submit a pull
request to the MPF codebase!)

List of supported control systems & hardware
--------------------------------------------

Here's a list of all the different types of control systems and hardware that
MPF currently supports. If there's a type of hardware you'd like us to support
that you don't see on this list, please
`post a message to the MPF Users Google Group
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_ and we'll go from there.

type of hardware.
