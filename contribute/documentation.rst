Contributing to MPF's Documentation
===================================

Want to help make these docs better! Great! We'd love any help, whether it's as
small as correcting a typo, adding to a section that isn't clear, adding your
own How To guide, or whatever else you want to change.

Here's the process. This is pretty high level for now. We'll add detailed
instructions soon.

#. Clone the mpf-docs repo from GitHub. Note that there are several branches,
   corresponding to the version of MPF, so be sure to grab the right one.
#. To build the docs locally, you'll need *sphinx* and *sphinx_bootstrap_theme*.
#. Make your changes.
#. Add your name to the ``/authors/index.rst`` doc.
#. Run ``make html`` to ensure everything builds properly without any warnings.
#. Submit your pull request.
