How MPF versions map to Docs versions
=====================================

Since MPF versions are constantly changing, we're also constantly adding and improving documentation which is available
via docs.missionpinball.org. When you visit the docs website, you can see the version of MPF in the URL, like this:

::

   docs.missionpinball.org/en/<version>

The problem with this is that since the version changes so often, links to the most recent version of MPF will change
often as well which is confusing for Google and people who share links.

To combat this, we have a special version link called **latest** which always points to the latest version of MPF.

The current latest version of MPF is 0.32, which means the "latest" links are for MPF 0.32, but the prior versions
are also available:

::

   docs.missionpinball.org/en/latest
   docs.missionpinball.org/en/0.31
   docs.missionpinball.org/en/0.30

You can access other versions of the documentation by clicking on the "Read The Docs" menu in the lower left corner of
any page in the documentation website.

If you view the MPF project on GitHub, you'll notice that there are branches which follow the same naming scheme, (and
that the "dev" branch in GitHub is the "latest" version of the docs).
