How MPF versions map to Docs versions
=====================================

Since MPF versions are constantly changing, we're also constantly adding and
improving documentation which is available via docs.missionpinball.org. When
you visit the docs website, you can see the version of MPF in the URL, like
this:

::

   docs.missionpinball.org/en/<version>

The version of the docs is also in green in the lower left corner (where it
says something like "v:latest" or "v:0.31".

Since the documentation is always changing, there's a special version called
"latest" which always points to the latest version of the documentation (which
corresponds to the latest version of MPF).

In general, it's ok to use the latest version of the documentation even if
you're using an older version of MPF. When we add features to MPF, you'll see
a "New in version X.XX" note in that section of the documentation. However
you can click that "Read the Docs" link in the lower left to see a specific
older version of the documentation if you want.
