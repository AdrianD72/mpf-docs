Example Configuration Files
===========================

MPF is very complex with lots of modules and options. In order to make sure
that everything works, we have over 700 automated tests that run every time we
add or change something in MPF in order to make sure we didn't break something.

All of these automated tests include config files (machine configs,
mode configs, and show files). In many ways, these config files are the
"ultimate truth" when it comes to what configs actually work with MPF.

All of the links below show the actual config files (pulled from the MPF and
MPF-MC packages) that are used to test MPF. They're also a valuable resource
for people creating games with MPF since they show many different options and
configurations that are known to work.

You can click on any of the links below to see the actual config files for
each topic. Each link may have multiple separate machine configs, mode configs,
and/or show configs.
