event_players (example config files)
====================================

Machine config examples
-----------------------

Here are some example machine-wide config files that show
real-world examples of how these configs are used.

Note that there are multiple machine config
examples here. They're just included to show different
options. You wouldn't actually use more than one.

.. literalinclude:: /example_configs/event_players/config/test_event_player.yaml
   :caption: `your_machine_folder/config/test_event_player.yaml </_static/event_players/config/test_event_player.yaml>`_
   :language: yaml

.. literalinclude:: /example_configs/event_players/config/test_queue_event_player.yaml
   :caption: `your_machine_folder/config/test_queue_event_player.yaml </_static/event_players/config/test_queue_event_player.yaml>`_
   :language: yaml

Mode config examples
--------------------

Here are some example mode config files that go along with the machine-wide
config above.

.. literalinclude:: /example_configs/event_players/modes/mode1/config/mode1.yaml
   :caption: `your_machine_folder/modes/mode1/config/mode1.yaml </_static/event_players/modes/mode1/config/mode1.yaml>`_
