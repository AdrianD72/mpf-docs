Installing MPF on Linux
=======================
While this procedure is being refined, here are the basic steps for installing MPF .30 on Debian flavors of Linux.

Download the MPF Debian Installer from https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/archive/dev.zip

Unzip, and from a terminal run ./install from the folder you unzipped the files to. Consult the
README for more information. We'll update this page in the next few days with more information.
