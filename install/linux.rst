Installing MPF on Linux
=======================

As part of our automated build process, we build and test MPF and MPF-MC against Ubuntu 14.04 & 16.04 and Debian jessie.

Download the MPF Debian Installer (which is used for all of these) from
https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/archive/master.zip

Unzip it, and from a terminal run ``./install`` from the folder you unzipped the files to. Consult the
README for more information.

Running MPF

See the :doc:`/running/index` for details and command-line options.
