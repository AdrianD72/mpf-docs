Installing MPF on Linux
=======================
While this procedure is being refined, here are the basic steps for installing MPF .30 on Debian flavors of Linux.

Download the MPF Debian Installer from https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/archive/dev.zip

Unzip, and from a terminal run ./install from the folder you unzipped the files to. Consult the
README for more information. We'll update this page soon with more information.

Running MPF
-----------

Starting with MPF 0.30, you run MPF by running the "mpf" command directly. (e
.g. you do not have to run "python" from the command prompt). For example, to
launch both the MPF game engine and the media controller, you simply run:

::

   mpf both

This is the same command on all platforms. See the :doc:`running/index` for
details and command-line options.
