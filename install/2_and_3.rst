Note for running Python 2 and Python 3 side-by-side
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're on a fresh computer that doesn't already have Python installed, you
can skip this section.

If you already have Python 2.x installed (perhaps from a previous version of
MPF), you can choose to uninstall Python 2 first and then install Python 3. That
is probably easier since you only have "one" Python.

If you install Python 3 when you already have Python 2, then you will have two
Pythons. That's perfectly fine. The only catch is that if you do that, you need
to add a "3" to the end of every Python command so your computer knows you want
the Python 3 version of that command.

For example, wherever you see ``python`` in the docs, you would actually type
``python3``, and wherever you see ``pip``, you would type ``pip3``.

Again, you only need this if you installed Python 3 on a system that already has
Python 2 on it. If you don't want to do this, just uninstall Python 2 first.
