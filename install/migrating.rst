Migrating from older versions of MPF
====================================

Upgrading MPF to the latest version
-----------------------------------
This is covered in the relevant install sections:

 * Linux: :doc:`</install/linux#keeping-mpf-up-to-date>`_
 * Windows: :doc:`</install/windows#keeping-mpf-up-to-date>`_
 * Mac: :doc:`</install/mac#keeping-mpf-up-to-date>`_

If you are upgrading from 0.21 (or earlier) you need to install Python 3 (as explained in the installation section for your platform).

Migrate your config
-------------------
A migrator exists for config version 3 (0.21 and earlier) to 4 (0.30 to 0.33).
There will be a migrator for version 4 to 5 (version 0.50) when 0.50 is released.
If you encounter any problems during migration feel free to ask in the forum.
