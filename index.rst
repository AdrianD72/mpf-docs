Mission Pinball Framework documentation
=======================================

Everything you need to know about the `Mission Pinball Framework <http://missionpinball.org>`_ (MPF).

.. tip::

   You can download PDF, Epub, and HTML versions of these docs. Click the "Read the Docs" link in the
   lower left corner for the links.

**Note about MPF versions:** The latest released version of MPF is |release|, but the documentation you're reading now
is valid for MPF versions |version|. See the :doc:`MPF software & documentation versions </versions/understanding>`
page for details.

How the documentation is organized
----------------------------------

* :doc:`Overview </start/index>` explains what MPF is, how it works, and what types of pinball machines
  and control systems you can use.
* :doc:`Installation </install/index>` guides walk you through downloading and installing MPF and getting
  one of the example machines working. (You don't need your own physical machine to do this.)
* :doc:`Tutorials </tutorial/index>` take you through a series of steps to create your own machine
  configuration in MPF from scratch. Start here if you're new to MPF. (Also see the `First Steps`_ below.)
* `Topic guides`_ discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and contain useful background
  information about all the different parts of MPF, including how it interacts with pinball mechanisms,
  game logic, displays, sound, and the various physical hardware control systems.
* :doc:`The Cookbook </cookbook/index>` shows you how to implement features of real pinball machines
  using MPF. This is great for the "How do I build something like X?" questions you might have.
* `Reference Guides`_ contain technical reference listings of all the settings for the MPF config files,
  event names, common player and machine variables, and example projects you can learn from.
* `Developer guides`_ have technical information for software developers who want to write their own code
  for their machines or who want to help contribute to the MPF project itself.

First steps
-----------
If you're brand-new to MPF, start here.

* :doc:`MPF Overview </start/index>`: What MPF is and how it works.
* :doc:`/install/index`: Download and install MPF.
* :doc:`/tutorial/index`: Step-by-step beginner's guide.
* :doc:`Pick your hardware platform </hardware/index>`. You can start the tutorial without a physical machine, but at
  some point you'll need to buy some hardware, since MPF is for real-life physical pinball machines!

Topic guides
------------
* :doc:`/hardware/index`: hardware control systems such as the P-ROC, FAST Pinball, and Open Pinball Project hardware.
* :doc:`/mechs/index`: switches, coils, lights, troughs, flippers, etc.
* :doc:`/game_logic/index`: modes, scoring, multiballs, ball saves, etc.
* :doc:`/displays/index`: DMDs, LCDs, slides, widgets, animations, text, etc.
* :doc:`/mc/index`: The MPF Media Controller (MPF-MC), the Unity 3D Backbox Server, creating your own MC
* :doc:`/sound/index`: sound tracks, music, volume, sound effects
* :doc:`/shows/index`: sequences of lights, sounds, slides, etc.
* :doc:`/assets/index`: videos, images, animations, sound files

Reference guides
----------------
* :doc:`/events/index`: All the standard events MPF has, and how to use them.
* :doc:`/config/index`: Lists every config setting and all the options.
* :doc:`/examples/index`: Huge list of example config files you can learn from.
* :doc:`/player_vars/index`: Lists all the built-in player variables and parameters.
* :doc:`/machine_vars/index`: Lists all the standard machine variables.
* :doc:`Example Machines </example_machines/index>`: List of several example machine projects.
