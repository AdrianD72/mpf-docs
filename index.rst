Contributing to MPF
-------------------
Do you want to help with MPF? Great! MPF was started by Brian Madden and Gabe
Knuth in 2014, but the core team is not 4 people and many more who have
contributed ideas and fixes.

Not a coder? No problem! You can contribute to the documentation too. Whether
it's a simple as fixing a typo or adding a How To Guide which explains something
you've done, we'd love to hear from you!
