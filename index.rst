Mission Pinball Framework |version| documentation
=================================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for the Mission Pinball Framework (MPF)
|release|, last updated |today|.

This documentation is available for :doc:`download </download>` in many popular
formats.

**Documentation Migration Status**

This is the new documentation site for MPF documentation, starting
with MPF v0.30. Everything on *docs.missionpinball.com* has been updated
and applies to MPF 0.30. Documentation for prior versions of MPF is still
available at `missionpinball.com/docs <https://missionpinball.com/docs>`_.

67 of 342 documents have been updated for 0.30 and added to this site. We're
working as fast as we can, but there are 206,937 total words in the MPF
documentation, so this process may take awhile. We're hoping to have it complete
by June, 2016.

MPF has a lot of documentation. Here are some of the big parts you can explore
now. Or view the tree menu on the left (or the "All Docs" in the top menu bar if
you're on a mobile device).
